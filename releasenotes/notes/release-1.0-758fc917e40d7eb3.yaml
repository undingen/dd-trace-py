prelude: >
  The Datadog APM Python team is happy to announce the release of v1.0.0 of
  ddtrace. This release simplifies the public
  :ref:`interface<versioning_interfaces>` and introduces a formal
  :ref:`versioning policy<versioning>`. These changes future unlock performance
  improvements and new features while ensuring backwards compatibility for
  users.


  The v1.0.0 release is an important milestone for the library as it has grown
  substantially in scope. The first commit to the library was made on June 20,
  2016. Nearly sixty minor releases later, the library now includes over 60
  integrations for libraries and has expanded from tracing to
  support the Continuous Profiler and CI Visibility.


  .. important::
    Before upgrading to v1.0.0, we recommend users install
    ``ddtrace>=0.60.0,<1.0.0`` and enable deprecation warnings. All removals to
    the library interface and environment variables were deprecated on 0.x
    branch. For more on migrating to 1.x, consult :ref:`Upgrading from 0.x to
    1.x<upgrade-0.x>`.


  .. note::
    The changes to environment variables apply only to the configuration of the
    ddtrace library and not the Datadog Agent.



  Upgrading summary

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Removed legacy environment variables

  ************************************

  These environment variables have been removed. In all cases the same
  functionality is provided by other environment variables and replacements are
  provided as recommended actions for upgrading.

  Removed legacy tracing interfaces

  *********************************

  These methods and module attributes have been removed. Where the same
  functionality is provided by a different public method or module attribute, a
  recommended action is provided for upgrading. In a few limited cases, because
  the interface was no longer used or had been moved to the internal interface,
  it was removed and so no action is provided for upgrading.

  Removed legacy integration tracing

  **********************************

  These tracing functions in integrations were no longer used for automatic
  instrumentation so have been removed. Any manual instrumentation code in an
  application will need to be replaced with :py:meth:`ddtrace.patch_all` or
  :py:meth:`ddtrace.patch` when upgrading.

  Removed deprecated modules

  **************************

  These modules have been removed. Many were moved to the internal interface as
  they were not intended to be used as part of the public interface. In these
  cases, no action is provided for upgrading. In a few cases, other modules are
  provided as alternatives to maintain functionality.
